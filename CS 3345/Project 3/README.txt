ZIP File Consists of
-LazyBinarySearchTree.java
-main.java
-README.txt

Used IDE - IntelliJ for compiling and running program

NOTE
LazyBinarySearchTree should not have any errors and should work fine, but my main class was unable to process the command line arguments.
Therefore, I have included my main class, but it may not be able to read the input file or output file through command line.
